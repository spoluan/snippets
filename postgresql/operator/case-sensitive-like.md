In PostgreSQL, there is no direct `ISLIKE` keyword, but you might be referring to the `LIKE` operator, which is used for pattern matching in SQL. Additionally, the `ESCAPE` keyword is used in conjunction with `LIKE` to define a custom escape character for special symbols in patterns.

---

### **1. `LIKE` Operator**

The `LIKE` operator is used to match a string against a pattern. It is case-sensitive and works with two special wildcard characters:
- **`%`**: Matches zero or more characters.
- **`_`**: Matches exactly one character.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
column_name LIKE 'pattern'
```

---

#### **Examples of `LIKE`**

**1. Match Strings Starting with a Pattern**
```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```
- Matches names that start with `A` (e.g., `Alice`, `Andrew`).

---

**2. Match Strings Ending with a Pattern**
```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE '%son';
```
- Matches names that end with `son` (e.g., `Jackson`, `Harrison`).

---

**3. Match Strings Containing a Pattern**
```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE '%ar%';
```
- Matches names that contain `ar` (e.g., `Mark`, `Carol`).

---

**4. Match Strings with a Specific Length**
```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'A__';
```
- Matches names that start with `A` and are exactly 3 characters long (e.g., `Ann`, `Amy`).

---

### **2. `ESCAPE` Keyword**

The `ESCAPE` keyword is used with the `LIKE` operator to define a custom escape character. This is useful when you need to match the literal `%` or `_` characters in the pattern (since they are normally treated as wildcards).

#### **Syntax**
```sql
column_name LIKE 'pattern' ESCAPE 'escape_character'
```

---

#### **Examples of `ESCAPE`**

**1. Matching a Literal `%`**
Suppose you want to find names containing the literal `%` character.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE '%\%%' ESCAPE '\';
```
- The backslash (`\`) is defined as the escape character.
- The pattern `\%` matches the literal `%`.

---

**2. Matching a Literal `_`**
Suppose you want to find names containing the literal `_` character.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE '%\_%' ESCAPE '\';
```
- The backslash (`\`) escapes the `_`, so it matches the literal `_`.

---

**3. Using a Custom Escape Character**
You can define any character as the escape character.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE '%#%%' ESCAPE '#';
```
- The `#` is defined as the escape character.
- The pattern `#%` matches the literal `%`.

---

### **3. `ILIKE` (Case-Insensitive `LIKE`)**

PostgreSQL also provides the `ILIKE` operator, which performs case-insensitive pattern matching.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
column_name ILIKE 'pattern'
```

#### **Example**
```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name ILIKE 'a%';
```
- Matches names starting with `a` or `A` (e.g., `Alice`, `Andrew`).

---

### **4. Combining `LIKE` with Other Conditions**

You can combine `LIKE` with logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, etc., to create more complex filters.

#### **Example**
Find employees whose names start with `A` and end with `n`.
```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'A%' AND name LIKE '%n';
```

### **5. Summary of `LIKE` and `ESCAPE`**

| **Feature**       | **Description**                                               | **Example**                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `%`               | Matches zero or more characters.                              | `'A%'` matches `Alice`, `Andrew`.     |
| `_`               | Matches exactly one character.                                | `'A_'` matches `Ann`, `Amy`.          |
| `ESCAPE`          | Defines a custom escape character to match `%` or `_`.        | `LIKE '%\%%' ESCAPE '\'` matches `50%`. |
| `ILIKE`           | Case-insensitive version of `LIKE`.                           | `'a%'` matches `Alice`, `alice`.      |

### **Use Cases for `LIKE` and `ESCAPE`**

- **Search for patterns in text**: Use `LIKE` to find strings that match specific patterns (e.g., names, descriptions).
- **Handle special characters**: Use `ESCAPE` when dealing with `%` or `_` as literal characters in strings.
- **Case-insensitive search**: Use `ILIKE` for case-insensitive pattern matching.

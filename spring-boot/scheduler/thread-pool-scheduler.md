### **Thread Pool Scheduler in Spring Boot**

The **Thread Pool Scheduler** in Spring Boot is used to manage and execute scheduled tasks concurrently. By default, Spring Boot uses a single-threaded **default thread pool** for its scheduler. However, this can be customized to handle multiple tasks simultaneously by configuring the thread pool properties.

---

### **Default Thread Pool Behavior**

- **Default Thread Pool Size**: 1 (single-threaded execution).
- This means that only one scheduled task can run at a time. If multiple tasks are scheduled, they will execute sequentially.

---

### **Customizing the Thread Pool Scheduler**

You can configure the thread pool used by the scheduler in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file using the `spring.task.scheduling` prefix.

#### **Key Properties for Thread Pool Scheduler**
| **Property**                          | **Default** | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `spring.task.scheduling.pool.size`    | `1`         | Number of threads in the scheduler's thread pool.                              |
| `spring.task.scheduling.thread-name-prefix` | `task-`     | Prefix for the thread names in the scheduler's thread pool.                     |

---

### **Example Configuration**

#### **application.properties**
```properties
# Scheduler Thread Pool Configuration
spring.task.scheduling.pool.size=10
spring.task.scheduling.thread-name-prefix=my-schedule-
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`spring.task.scheduling.pool.size=10`**
   - Configures the thread pool to have 10 threads, allowing up to 10 scheduled tasks to run concurrently.

2. **`spring.task.scheduling.thread-name-prefix=my-schedule-`**
   - Sets the prefix for threads in the pool, making it easier to identify them in logs (e.g., `my-schedule-1`, `my-schedule-2`).

---

### **Thread Pool Scheduler vs Async Execution**

- **Thread Pool Scheduler**:
  - Used for scheduled tasks (`@Scheduled`).
  - Configured with `spring.task.scheduling.*`.
  - Separate from the async thread pool.

- **Async Execution**:
  - Used for asynchronous methods (`@Async`).
  - Configured with `spring.task.execution.*`.

---

### **Advanced Configuration**

For more fine-grained control, you can define a custom `TaskScheduler` bean in your Spring configuration:

#### Example:
```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskScheduler;

@Configuration
public class SchedulerConfig {

    @Bean
    public ThreadPoolTaskScheduler taskScheduler() {
        ThreadPoolTaskScheduler scheduler = new ThreadPoolTaskScheduler();
        scheduler.setPoolSize(5); // Set the thread pool size
        scheduler.setThreadNamePrefix("custom-scheduler-");
        return scheduler;
    }
}
```

- **`setPoolSize(5)`**: Configures the thread pool size.
- **`setThreadNamePrefix("custom-scheduler-")`**: Sets a custom prefix for thread names.

---

### **When to Increase the Thread Pool Size**

You should increase the thread pool size if:
1. You have multiple scheduled tasks that need to run concurrently.
2. A single task takes a long time to execute, potentially blocking other tasks.
3. Your application requires high throughput for scheduled jobs.

---

### **Best Practices**

1. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Use monitoring tools to observe the thread pool usage and adjust the size accordingly.

2. **Set Appropriate Thread Prefix**:
   - Use meaningful prefixes for easier debugging and tracking in logs.

3. **Avoid Overloading**:
   - Ensure the thread pool size is not too large to avoid resource contention.

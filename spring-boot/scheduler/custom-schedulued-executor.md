### **Custom Scheduled Executor in Spring Boot**

A **Custom Scheduled Executor** in Spring Boot allows you to define your own thread pool or executor for managing scheduled tasks. By default, Spring Boot uses its internal `ThreadPoolTaskScheduler` for scheduling tasks. However, for more control over thread management, you can override this behavior by defining a custom `ScheduledExecutorService` or `TaskScheduler`.

### **Why Use a Custom Scheduled Executor?**

1. **Fine-Grained Control**:
   - You can configure the thread pool size, priorities, and other thread properties.
   
2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - A custom executor allows you to handle high-concurrency scenarios by increasing the thread pool size.
   
3. **Custom Thread Naming**:
   - You can assign custom names to threads for better debugging and monitoring.
   
4. **Compatibility with Virtual Threads**:
   - With modern Java versions (e.g., Loom), you can use virtual threads for lightweight, scalable scheduling.

### **How to Define a Custom Scheduled Executor**

The code in the image demonstrates how to define a custom scheduled executor using the `Executors` utility.

#### **Code Example: Custom Scheduled Executor**
```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

import java.util.concurrent.Executor;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService;

@Configuration
public class AsyncConfiguration {

    // Custom ScheduledExecutorService Bean
    @Bean
    public ScheduledExecutorService taskScheduler() {
        return Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(10); // Thread pool size: 10
    }

    // Custom Executor Bean using Virtual Threads (Java Loom)
    @Bean
    public Executor taskExecutor() {
        return Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor(); // Virtual threads for lightweight concurrency
    }
}
```

### **Explanation of the Code**

1. **`taskScheduler()`**
   - Returns a `ScheduledExecutorService` with a fixed thread pool size of 10.
   - This custom thread pool will be used to execute scheduled tasks (`@Scheduled`).

   **Key Method Used**:
   ```java
   Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(corePoolSize);
   ```
   - **`corePoolSize`**: The number of threads in the pool.

2. **`taskExecutor()`**
   - Returns an `Executor` using **virtual threads** (introduced in Java Loom).
   - Virtual threads are lightweight and allow for a large number of concurrent tasks without consuming significant system resources.

   **Key Method Used**:
   ```java
   Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
   ```
   - This creates a new virtual thread for each task, making it ideal for I/O-bound or highly concurrent tasks.

### **Benefits of Custom Scheduled Executor**

1. **Custom Thread Pool Size**:
   - You can configure the number of threads to match the workload of your application.

2. **Virtual Threads**:
   - With `newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()`, you can leverage virtual threads for better scalability and reduced overhead.

3. **Custom Thread Management**:
   - You can implement advanced thread management strategies, such as dynamic thread pool resizing or custom rejection policies.

4. **Improved Debugging**:
   - Custom thread names (e.g., via `setThreadFactory`) make it easier to trace issues in logs.

### **When to Use a Custom Scheduled Executor**

1. **High-Concurrency Scenarios**:
   - When you have many scheduled tasks running simultaneously.

2. **Long-Running Tasks**:
   - If tasks take a long time to execute, a larger thread pool prevents blocking other tasks.

3. **Integration with Virtual Threads**:
   - To take advantage of modern Java features for lightweight concurrency.

4. **Custom Behavior**:
   - When you need specific thread management features not provided by Spring's default scheduler.

### **Comparison: Default vs Custom Scheduled Executor**

| **Aspect**                | **Default Scheduler**                  | **Custom Scheduled Executor**                              |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Thread Pool Size**       | 1 (single-threaded by default)         | Fully configurable (e.g., 10 threads or virtual threads). |
| **Thread Naming**          | `task-` prefix                        | Customizable via thread factories or prefixes.            |
| **Scalability**            | Limited                               | Highly scalable with larger pools or virtual threads.     |
| **Advanced Features**      | Basic scheduling                      | Custom rejection policies, dynamic resizing, etc.         |

### **Key Considerations**

1. **Thread Pool Size**:
   - Choose a size that balances concurrency and resource usage. Too many threads can lead to resource contention.

2. **Virtual Threads**:
   - Ideal for I/O-bound tasks but may not be fully supported in all environments (requires Java Loom).

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensure proper exception handling in your scheduled tasks to avoid thread leakage or task failures.

4. **Shutdown**:
   - Properly shut down the custom executor during application shutdown to release resources.

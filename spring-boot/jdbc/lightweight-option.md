When working with **large datasets** in Spring's `JdbcTemplate`, the choice of method depends on how you intend to process the data. For large datasets, the goal is to minimize memory usage and avoid loading the entire result set into memory at once. Here's a breakdown of the options and their suitability for handling large datasets:

---

### **Lightweight Options for Large Datasets**

#### 1. **`query` with a `RowCallbackHandler`**
- **Best for large datasets**: This is the most lightweight option because it processes rows one at a time without storing them in memory.
- **How it works**: Instead of returning a list of mapped objects, the `RowCallbackHandler` processes each row as it is retrieved from the database. This avoids loading all rows into memory at once.
- **Use Case**: When you need to process each row individually (e.g., write to a file, perform calculations) without keeping the entire result set in memory.

**Example**:
```java
String sql = "SELECT course_id, title, description FROM course";

jdbcTemplate.query(sql, (rs) -> {
    while (rs.next()) {
        int courseId = rs.getInt("course_id");
        String title = rs.getString("title");
        String description = rs.getString("description");

        // Process the row (e.g., write to file, perform calculations)
        System.out.println("Course ID: " + courseId + ", Title: " + title);
    }
});
```

- **Advantages**:
  - Processes rows one by one.
  - Minimal memory usage.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - You must handle row processing manually.

#### 2. **`query` with a `ResultSetExtractor`**
- **Lightweight for custom processing**: This allows you to extract and process the result set manually, similar to `RowCallbackHandler`. However, it gives you full control over how the result set is processed.
- **How it works**: You implement a custom `ResultSetExtractor` to process rows as they are retrieved.
- **Use Case**: When you need to process large datasets and return a custom result (e.g., aggregate data).

**Example**:
```java
String sql = "SELECT course_id, title, description FROM course";

List<Course> courses = jdbcTemplate.query(sql, (ResultSet rs) -> {
    List<Course> result = new ArrayList<>();
    while (rs.next()) {
        Course course = new Course(
            rs.getInt("course_id"),
            rs.getString("title"),
            rs.getString("description")
        );
        result.add(course);
    }
    return result;
});
```

- **Advantages**:
  - Allows custom processing of rows.
  - Can return a custom result, such as a transformed list or aggregated data.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Slightly more complex than `RowCallbackHandler`.

#### 3. **`queryForRowSet`**
- **Lightweight and disconnected**: This method retrieves results as a `SqlRowSet`, which is similar to a `ResultSet` but is **disconnected** from the database. It is lightweight because it does not hold the entire dataset in memory, and you can process rows one by one.
- **How it works**: The `SqlRowSet` allows you to iterate over rows without fully loading them into memory.
- **Use Case**: When you need to process rows individually and want a lightweight, disconnected result set.

**Example**:
```java
String sql = "SELECT course_id, title, description FROM course";

SqlRowSet rowSet = jdbcTemplate.queryForRowSet(sql);
while (rowSet.next()) {
    int courseId = rowSet.getInt("course_id");
    String title = rowSet.getString("title");
    String description = rowSet.getString("description");

    // Process each row
    System.out.println("Course ID: " + courseId + ", Title: " + title);
}
```

- **Advantages**:
  - Disconnected and lightweight.
  - Allows row-by-row processing.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited functionality compared to `ResultSet`.

---

#### 4. **Streaming with `query`**
- **Efficient for very large datasets**: You can use `query` with a `RowMapper` and enable streaming to process rows one at a time. This avoids loading all rows into memory.
- **How it works**: You configure the `DataSource` or `JdbcTemplate` to use a **streaming result set**, which fetches rows incrementally.
- **Use Case**: When processing very large datasets where memory usage is critical.

**Example**:
```java
String sql = "SELECT course_id, title, description FROM course";

jdbcTemplate.query(sql, (rs) -> {
    while (rs.next()) {
        int courseId = rs.getInt("course_id");
        String title = rs.getString("title");
        String description = rs.getString("description");

        // Process each row
        System.out.println("Course ID: " + courseId + ", Title: " + title);
    }
});
```

**To Enable Streaming**:
- For MySQL:
  ```properties
  spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.useServerPrepStmts=true
  spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.cachePrepStmts=false
  spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.useCursorFetch=true
  ```
- For PostgreSQL:
  Ensure the query uses a cursor or fetch size:
  ```java
  jdbcTemplate.setFetchSize(50); // Fetch rows in batches of 50
  ```

- **Advantages**:
  - Processes rows incrementally.
  - Very efficient for extremely large datasets.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires proper configuration of the database connection.

### Comparison of Lightweight Methods

| **Method**               | **Memory Usage**       | **Processing Style**      | **Use Case**                                   |
|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `RowCallbackHandler`     | Minimal               | Row-by-row                | Best for large datasets with manual processing. |
| `ResultSetExtractor`     | Minimal               | Custom processing         | When you need to process rows and return a custom result. |
| `queryForRowSet`         | Minimal               | Row-by-row (disconnected) | When you need a disconnected, lightweight result set. |
| Streaming with `query`   | Minimal (streaming)   | Row-by-row                | When working with extremely large datasets efficiently. |

---

### **Which is the Most Lightweight?**

- **For Processing Rows Individually**: Use `RowCallbackHandler` or `queryForRowSet`.
- **For Custom Processing**: Use `ResultSetExtractor`.
- **For Streaming Large Results**: Use `query` with streaming enabled (e.g., `setFetchSize`).

#### **Recommendation**:
If you're working with **very large datasets**, prefer **streaming** or **RowCallbackHandler**, as they are the most memory-efficient options for row-by-row processing.

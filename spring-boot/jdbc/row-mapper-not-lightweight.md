Using a **`RowMapper`** in **Spring's `JdbcTemplate`** is **not the most lightweight option** for handling large datasets because it **maps all rows into memory** at once by default. This means that the entire result set is processed and stored in a `List<T>`, which can lead to high memory usage if the dataset is very large.

However, it can still be a good choice for smaller or moderately sized datasets where memory constraints are not a concern. Let me explain in detail:

---

### **Why `RowMapper` is Not Lightweight for Large Datasets**
1. **Result Set is Fully Loaded into Memory**:
   - When you use `RowMapper` with the `query` method, the entire result set is fetched from the database and mapped into a list of objects (`List<T>`).
   - For large datasets, this can lead to **OutOfMemoryError** or excessive memory usage because all rows are stored in memory simultaneously.

   Example:
   ```java
   String sql = "SELECT * FROM course";
   List<Course> courses = jdbcTemplate.query(sql, rowMapper);
   ```
   - If the `course` table has millions of rows, this query will attempt to load all those rows into memory, which is not efficient.

2. **Batch Processing is Not Possible**:
   - `RowMapper` does not allow you to process rows incrementally (row-by-row). Instead, it waits for the entire result set to be retrieved before mapping rows into objects.

---

### **When is `RowMapper` Suitable?**
- **Small or Moderate Datasets**:
  - If the number of rows is small (e.g., a few hundred or thousand), `RowMapper` is convenient and easy to use.
  - It simplifies the code by abstracting away the row mapping logic.

- **When Memory Usage is Not a Concern**:
  - If your application has sufficient memory and the result set size is predictable, `RowMapper` is a good choice.

### **Lightweight Alternatives to `RowMapper` for Large Datasets**

If you're dealing with large datasets, there are better options than `RowMapper` to process rows incrementally and minimize memory usage:

#### 1. **Row-by-Row Processing with `RowCallbackHandler`**
   - **How it Works**: Processes rows one at a time as they are retrieved from the database, without storing them in memory.
   - **Memory Usage**: Minimal (only one row is processed at a time).
   - **Use Case**: When you need to process each row (e.g., write to a file or perform calculations) without keeping the entire result set in memory.

   Example:
   ```java
   String sql = "SELECT * FROM course";
   jdbcTemplate.query(sql, (rs) -> {
       while (rs.next()) {
           int courseId = rs.getInt("course_id");
           String title = rs.getString("title");
           String description = rs.getString("description");

           // Process the row (e.g., write to file or perform calculations)
           System.out.println("Course ID: " + courseId + ", Title: " + title);
       }
   });
   ```

#### 2. **Custom Processing with `ResultSetExtractor`**
   - **How it Works**: Allows you to manually process the result set and return a custom result (e.g., aggregated data or partial results).
   - **Memory Usage**: Minimal, as it processes rows incrementally.
   - **Use Case**: When you need to process rows and return a custom result (e.g., a transformed list or aggregated data).

   Example:
   ```java
   String sql = "SELECT * FROM course";
   List<Course> courses = jdbcTemplate.query(sql, (ResultSet rs) -> {
       List<Course> result = new ArrayList<>();
       while (rs.next()) {
           Course course = new Course(
               rs.getInt("course_id"),
               rs.getString("title"),
               rs.getString("description")
           );
           result.add(course);
       }
       return result;
   });
   ```

#### 3. **Streaming with `RowMapper`**
   - **How it Works**: You can enable **streaming** to process rows incrementally with a `RowMapper`. This avoids loading the entire result set into memory.
   - **Memory Usage**: Minimal, as rows are fetched in batches and processed one at a time.
   - **Use Case**: When you want the convenience of `RowMapper` but need to handle large datasets efficiently.

   **Configuration for Streaming**:
   - For MySQL:
     Add the following properties to enable streaming:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.useServerPrepStmts=true
     spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.cachePrepStmts=false
     spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.useCursorFetch=true
     ```
   - For PostgreSQL:
     Set the fetch size:
     ```java
     jdbcTemplate.setFetchSize(50); // Fetch rows in batches of 50
     ```

   **Example**:
   ```java
   String sql = "SELECT * FROM course";
   jdbcTemplate.query(sql, (rs) -> {
       while (rs.next()) {
           Course course = rowMapper.mapRow(rs, rs.getRow());
           // Process the row
           System.out.println(course);
       }
   });
   ```

---

#### 4. **`queryForRowSet`**
   - **How it Works**: Retrieves results as a `SqlRowSet`, which is a lightweight, disconnected representation of a result set.
   - **Memory Usage**: Minimal, as it processes rows incrementally.
   - **Use Case**: When you need to iterate over rows without mapping them to objects.

   Example:
   ```java
   String sql = "SELECT * FROM course";
   SqlRowSet rowSet = jdbcTemplate.queryForRowSet(sql);
   while (rowSet.next()) {
       int courseId = rowSet.getInt("course_id");
       String title = rowSet.getString("title");
       String description = rowSet.getString("description");

       // Process each row
       System.out.println("Course ID: " + courseId + ", Title: " + title);
   }
   ```

| `queryForRowSet`         | Minimal               | Row-by-row (disconnected) | When you need a disconnected, lightweight result set. |
| Streaming with `RowMapper` | Minimal (streaming)   | Row-by-row                | When working with extremely large datasets efficiently. |

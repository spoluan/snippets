### **Using `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()` in Spring Boot**

The example in the image demonstrates the use of **virtual threads** introduced in Java 19 (as part of Project Loom) to create a custom executor for asynchronous tasks. This is a great modern approach to handling concurrency with lightweight threads, offering better scalability compared to traditional thread pools.

### **What is `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()`?**

- **Virtual Threads**:
  - Virtual threads are lightweight threads introduced in Project Loom.
  - Unlike traditional platform threads, virtual threads are managed by the JVM and are much more resource-efficient.
  - They allow you to create thousands (or even millions) of concurrent threads without consuming significant system resources.

- **`newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()`**:
  - This method returns an `Executor` that creates a new virtual thread for each task submitted.
  - It eliminates the need for a fixed-size thread pool, as virtual threads are cheap to create and manage.

### **How It Works in Spring Boot**

When you define a custom executor using `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()`, Spring Boot will use this executor for all `@Async` methods if the bean name is `taskExecutor`.

#### **Example Code**

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

import java.util.concurrent.Executor;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

@Configuration
public class AsyncConfig {

    @Bean
    public Executor taskExecutor() {
        return Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
    }
}
```

### **Advantages of Using Virtual Threads**

1. **High Concurrency**:
   - Virtual threads are much lighter than platform threads, allowing you to handle a very high number of concurrent tasks without exhausting system resources.

2. **Simplified Thread Management**:
   - No need to configure `corePoolSize`, `maxPoolSize`, or `queueCapacity`. Each task gets its own virtual thread.

3. **Better Resource Utilization**:
   - Virtual threads are parked when waiting (e.g., on I/O operations) without blocking system threads, freeing up resources for other tasks.

4. **No Rejection Policy Needed**:
   - Since virtual threads are created per task, thereâ€™s no risk of task rejection due to thread pool exhaustion.

### **When to Use Virtual Threads**

- **I/O-Heavy Applications**:
  - Applications performing a lot of blocking I/O (e.g., database queries, HTTP requests) benefit the most from virtual threads.

- **High Concurrency Requirements**:
  - If your application needs to handle thousands or millions of concurrent tasks, virtual threads are an excellent choice.

- **Simplified Configuration**:
  - If you want to avoid the complexity of configuring traditional thread pools, virtual threads provide a simpler alternative.

---

### **Limitations of Virtual Threads**

1. **Compatibility**:
   - Virtual threads require Java 19 or higher. Ensure your application is running on a compatible JDK.

2. **Not Always Necessary**:
   - For CPU-bound tasks, a traditional thread pool with a fixed number of threads (based on the number of CPU cores) might still be more efficient.

3. **Limited Ecosystem Support**:
   - Some libraries or frameworks may not yet fully support virtual threads, especially if they rely on thread-local storage or assume platform threads.

### **Combining Virtual Threads with Other Executors**

You can define multiple executors in your application and use them for different purposes. For example:

#### **Example: Combining Virtual Threads with ThreadPoolTaskExecutor**

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor;

import java.util.concurrent.Executor;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

@Configuration
public class AsyncConfig {

    @Bean(name = "virtualThreadExecutor")
    public Executor virtualThreadExecutor() {
        return Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
    }

    @Bean(name = "fixedThreadPoolExecutor")
    public Executor fixedThreadPoolExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
        executor.setCorePoolSize(5);
        executor.setMaxPoolSize(10);
        executor.setQueueCapacity(25);
        executor.setThreadNamePrefix("FixedThreadPool-");
        executor.initialize();
        return executor;
    }
}
```

#### **Usage in `@Async` Methods**

```java
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Async;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class AsyncService {

    @Async("virtualThreadExecutor")
    public void executeWithVirtualThreads() {
        System.out.println("Running on: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }

    @Async("fixedThreadPoolExecutor")
    public void executeWithFixedThreadPool() {
        System.out.println("Running on: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
```

---

### **Output Example**

If you run the above service, you might see output like this:

- For `executeWithVirtualThreads`:
  ```
  Running on: VirtualThread[#1]/runnable
  Running on: VirtualThread[#2]/runnable
  ```

- For `executeWithFixedThreadPool`:
  ```
  Running on: FixedThreadPool-1
  Running on: FixedThreadPool-2
  ```

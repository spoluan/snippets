 

### **Dynamic Executor in Spring**

Dynamic executors allow you to customize the behavior of thread pools or task execution strategies dynamically, depending on the application's needs. In the provided code snippet, Spring Boot is used to configure two types of executors: a virtual thread executor and a single-thread executor. These executors are configured as Spring beans, making them available for dependency injection.

Spring's `@Async` annotation supports specifying the name of the executor bean to use for asynchronous tasks. By defining multiple executor beans, you can dynamically decide which executor will handle a specific task by referencing the appropriate bean name in the `@Async` annotation.

---

### **How It Works**

#### **1. Define Multiple Executor Beans**
In the provided code, two executors are defined as Spring beans:

- `taskExecutor`: Uses virtual threads for high concurrency.
- `singleTaskExecutor`: Uses a single-threaded executor for sequential task execution.

```java
@Configuration
public class AsyncConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public Executor taskExecutor() {
        return Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
    }

    @Bean
    public Executor singleTaskExecutor() {
        return Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
    }
}
```

Each bean is uniquely named based on its method name (`taskExecutor` and `singleTaskExecutor`).

---

#### **2. Specify the Executor in `@Async`**
You can specify which executor should handle a particular asynchronous method by using the `@Async` annotation with the bean name.

For example:
```java
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Async;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class AsyncService {

    // Use the "taskExecutor" bean (virtual thread executor)
    @Async("taskExecutor")
    public void performHighConcurrencyTask() {
        System.out.println("Executing with taskExecutor: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }

    // Use the "singleTaskExecutor" bean (single-threaded executor)
    @Async("singleTaskExecutor")
    public void performSequentialTask() {
        System.out.println("Executing with singleTaskExecutor: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
```

---

#### **3. Enable Async Support**
To enable asynchronous processing in your Spring application, add the `@EnableAsync` annotation to a configuration class.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableAsync;

@Configuration
@EnableAsync
public class AsyncConfig {
}
```

---

#### **4. Call Methods Dynamically**
When you call the above methods, Spring will route the task to the specified executor.

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class AsyncCaller {

    @Autowired
    private AsyncService asyncService;

    public void callTasks() {
        // This will use the "taskExecutor" (virtual thread executor)
        asyncService.performHighConcurrencyTask();

        // This will use the "singleTaskExecutor" (single-threaded executor)
        asyncService.performSequentialTask();
    }
}
```

---

### **Dynamic Executor Selection in Action**

When you run the application, you will see that the tasks are executed by different executors based on the `@Async` annotation.

#### **Example Output**
```
Executing with taskExecutor: VirtualThread-1
Executing with singleTaskExecutor: pool-1-thread-1
```

### **Benefits of Dynamic Executor Selection**

1. **Fine-Grained Control**:
   - You can assign different executors to handle different types of tasks (e.g., CPU-intensive vs. I/O-bound tasks).

2. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Each executor bean can have its own configuration, such as thread pool size, queue capacity, etc.

3. **Improved Resource Management**:
   - By using specific executors for specific tasks, you can better manage system resources.

4. **Flexibility**:
   - You can easily add more executors in the future and assign them to specific tasks.

---

### **Advanced Example: Custom Executors with ThreadPoolTaskExecutor**

Instead of using default executors, you can define custom executors with specific configurations using `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor`.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor;

import java.util.concurrent.Executor;

@Configuration
public class CustomAsyncConfig {

    @Bean(name = "customTaskExecutor")
    public Executor customTaskExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
        executor.setCorePoolSize(5);
        executor.setMaxPoolSize(10);
        executor.setQueueCapacity(25);
        executor.setThreadNamePrefix("CustomExecutor-");
        executor.initialize();
        return executor;
    }

    @Bean(name = "anotherTaskExecutor")
    public Executor anotherTaskExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
        executor.setCorePoolSize(2);
        executor.setMaxPoolSize(5);
        executor.setQueueCapacity(10);
        executor.setThreadNamePrefix("AnotherExecutor-");
        executor.initialize();
        return executor;
    }
}
```

You can now assign these executors to specific tasks using their bean names in `@Async`.

```java
@Service
public class AdvancedAsyncService {

    @Async("customTaskExecutor")
    public void executeWithCustomExecutor() {
        System.out.println("Executing with customTaskExecutor: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }

    @Async("anotherTaskExecutor")
    public void executeWithAnotherExecutor() {
        System.out.println("Executing with anotherTaskExecutor: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
```

### **Key Points to Remember**

1. **Bean Naming Determines Executor Selection**:
   - The method name of the executor bean (`taskExecutor`, `singleTaskExecutor`, etc.) is used as the bean name.
   - You can explicitly specify the executor in `@Async("beanName")`.

2. **Default Executor**:
   - If you do not specify an executor name in `@Async`, Spring will use the **default executor**.
   - You can configure the default executor by overriding the `AsyncConfigurer` interface.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.AsyncConfigurer;
import org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor;

import java.util.concurrent.Executor;

@Configuration
public class DefaultAsyncConfig implements AsyncConfigurer {

    @Override
    public Executor getAsyncExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
        executor.setCorePoolSize(5);
        executor.setMaxPoolSize(10);
        executor.setQueueCapacity(25);
        executor.setThreadNamePrefix("DefaultExecutor-");
        executor.initialize();
        return executor;
    }
}
```

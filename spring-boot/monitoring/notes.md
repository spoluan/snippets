### **Warning: Securing Actuator Endpoints**

1. **Sensitive Information**:
   - Actuator endpoints often expose sensitive information about your application, such as health status, metrics, configuration properties, and more.
   - These details could potentially be exploited if accessed by unauthorized users.

2. **Avoid Public Exposure**:
   - It is highly recommended **NOT** to expose Actuator endpoints to the public or make them accessible to everyone.

3. **Security Measures**:
   - **Firewall or Proxy Server**:
     - Use a firewall or a proxy server (e.g., **Nginx** or **Apache**) to restrict access to Actuator endpoints.
     - Configure these tools to allow only specific IP addresses or authenticated users to access the endpoints.
   - **Spring Security**:
     - Integrate Spring Security to secure Actuator endpoints with authentication and authorization.
   - **Environment-Specific Exposure**:
     - Limit Actuator endpoint exposure to internal environments such as staging or production, and avoid exposing them in public-facing environments.

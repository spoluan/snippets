### **Parallel Stream in Java**

The **Parallel Stream** feature in Java allows stream operations to be executed in parallel, making it easier to utilize multiple CPU cores for faster processing.

### **1. Key Concepts**

- **Parallel Execution**:  
  Parallel streams divide the data into multiple chunks and process them concurrently using multiple threads.

- **ForkJoinPool**:  
  By default, parallel streams use the **ForkJoinPool**, which runs tasks using a number of threads equal to the number of available CPU cores.

- **Automatic Thread Management**:  
  Java handles thread creation and management for parallel streams, so developers don't need to manage threads explicitly.

### **2. Key Points from the Image**

1. **Parallel Execution**:  
   - Parallel streams allow multiple processes to run simultaneously.
   - This is useful for computationally intensive tasks.

2. **Default Behavior**:  
   - Parallel streams use the **ForkJoinPool** by default.
   - The number of threads used is equivalent to the number of CPU cores available.

3. **Parallel Programming**:  
   - While parallel streams simplify parallel processing, understanding Java threads and concurrency is important for more complex use cases.

### **3. Example Code: Creating a Parallel Stream**

```java
@Test
void testParallelStream() {
    List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

    // Create a parallel stream
    Stream<Integer> parallelStream = numbers.stream().parallel();

    // Process each number in parallel
    parallelStream.forEach(number -> {
        System.out.println("Thread " + Thread.currentThread() + " : " + number);
    });
}
```

### **4. Explanation of the Code**

1. **Creating a Parallel Stream**:  
   - `numbers.stream().parallel()` converts a sequential stream into a parallel stream.

2. **Processing Elements**:  
   - The `forEach` method processes each element in the stream.
   - `Thread.currentThread()` is used to display the thread processing a particular element, demonstrating parallel execution.

3. **Output Example**:  
   The output will show that multiple threads are processing the elements:
   ```plaintext
   Thread Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1,5,main] : 1
   Thread Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3,5,main] : 2
   Thread Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-2,5,main] : 3
   ...
   ```

### **5. When to Use Parallel Streams**

#### **Pros**:
- **Performance Boost**:  
  For large datasets or computationally heavy tasks, parallel streams can significantly reduce execution time.
  
- **Simpler Code**:  
  Parallel streams abstract away the complexity of thread management.

#### **Cons**:
- **Overhead**:  
  For small datasets, the overhead of managing threads can outweigh the performance benefits.
  
- **Thread Safety**:  
  Shared mutable state can lead to race conditions if not handled properly.

### **6. Best Practices**

1. **Use for Large Datasets**:  
   Parallel streams are most effective for large collections or intensive computations.

2. **Avoid Mutable State**:  
   Ensure operations are stateless and thread-safe to prevent concurrency issues.

3. **Measure Performance**:  
   Always benchmark your code to ensure parallel streams provide a performance benefit.

4. **Be Aware of ForkJoinPool Limitations**:  
   If your application already uses the ForkJoinPool, parallel streams may compete for resources.

### **7. Comparison: Sequential vs Parallel Streams**

| **Feature**            | **Sequential Stream**             | **Parallel Stream**                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Execution**          | Single-threaded                   | Multi-threaded                       |
| **Performance**        | Slower for large datasets         | Faster for large datasets            |
| **Thread Management**  | No thread management required     | Threads managed by ForkJoinPool      |
| **Use Case**           | Small datasets or simple tasks    | Large datasets or intensive tasks    |
